                                      Week4 : Prediction Assignment Write up


The goal of this work is to predict the activity done by humans based on the analysis done in http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har.  To build this model, we are using pml training and testing datasets, which is being provided in the above mentioned website.
PACKAGES USED FOR ANALYSIS
For the analysis , the following packages are loaded
> library(ggplot2)
> library(scales)
> library(dplyr)
> library(caret)

READ THE DATA:
Initially we have to read the csv files pml-training  and pml-testing and also have to identify the missing values ,NA , Divison error values
> pmltrain<-read.csv("E:/Rprogram/mlweek4/pml-training.csv",header=T,na.strings=c("NA","","#DIV/0!"))
> dim(pmltrain)
[1] 19622   160
> colnames(pmltrain)

SPLITTING THE TRAINING DATA:
To build the model and to create out of sample error data partition is done on pml-training data in a ration 70%:30% 
> set.seed(32234)
> inTrain<-createDataPartition(y=pmltrain$classe,list=F,p=0.7)
> trainData<-pmltrain[inTrain,]
> testData<-pmltrain[-inTrain,]
> table(is.na(trainData))

Find which variables (if any) that are mostly na values:
> naprops <- colSums(is.na(trainData))/nrow(trainData)
> mostlyNAs <- names(naprops[naprops > 0.75]) # mostly being 75%
> mostlyNACols <- which(naprops > 0.75) # there's about 100 of them

Taking a small sample data for training where all naâ€™s are removed  
> set.seed(1256)
> smalltrain <- trainData %>% tbl_df %>% sample_n(size=1000)
> smalltrain <- smalltrain[,-mostlyNACols]
> smalltrain <- smalltrain[,-grep("X|user_name",names(smalltrain))]
> smalltrain <- smalltrain[,-grep("cvtd_timestamp",names(smalltrain))]
> smalltrain <- smalltrain[,-nearZeroVar(smalltrain)]
> modelVars <- names(smalltrain)
> modelVars1 <- modelVars[-grep("classe",modelVars)] # remove the classe var

Using random forest  with the predictors in the model variable we are predicting the classe variable
> set.seed(57)
> cleanedTrainData <- trainData[,modelVars]
> modelFit <- randomForest(classe ~., data=cleanedTrainData, type="class")

The values of the predictive model is stored in predTrain and confusion matrix is formed from predicted data to obtain the sample error
> predTrain <- predict(modelFit,newdata=trainData)
 
> confusionMatrix(predTrain,trainData$classe)$table

To get an out sample error from the 30% pml-training data which is given as testing data
> classe_col <- grep("classe",names(testData))
